  ## Description
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.


Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
  
  ## Installation

Users have the ability to devour the burger simple by clicking the devour it button which will remove the burger from the ready to eat list to the devoured list. Once again the user is able to devour as many burgers as they would like.
